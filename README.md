**Project Summary**


Marmite is a **food recipe blog** created by following a step-by-step tutorial using **Contentful** as CMS  for content management. It served as research groundwork for the work I later carried out in another project. You can see that project here: [Get Hub](https://github.com/Ursulavallejo/Get_hub).

Users can browse international dishes, view step-by-step instructions with high-quality photos, filter by cuisine, ingredients or difficulty level, and even add or edit recipes directly through the Contentful dashboard.
